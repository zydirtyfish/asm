Auto Send Mail Tool ( ASM )

This tool can help you to send emails in the form of HTML automatically. The only thing you need to do is to write the `mail_content` according to the format given in the source file. You can also modify this file by using the api given in writeAPI.py.

Start your "Hello world" mail by excuting `sh auto_send.sh` if you have finished the `mail_content` metioned above.

1. send_mail.py
   This is the kernel file by encapsulating `smtplib`. There is no need for you to know how it is realized, because you only need to modify the `mail_content` if you want to send mails automatically.

2. writeAPI.py
    You can modify the `mail_content` much easier by using the api in this file.
    `write_content(html)` : To modify the mail_msg
    `write_send_list(send_list)` : To modify the send_list
    `write_accessory_list(accessory_list)` : To modify the accessory list
    `write_img_list(img_list)` : To modify the images contained in the main_msg
    `write_all(content,subject,encoding,send_list,accessory_list,img_list)` : To modify the parameters all above
